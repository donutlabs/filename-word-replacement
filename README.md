# filename-word-replacement
Needed to rename a bunch of files with long filenames where only one word in the name needed replaced and preserve the rest of the filename. Wrote some powershell so I could just hit the parent folder and all the kids in one swoop. 

Make sure you change the filepath to the folder you want to hit.
Oldword is the word you want to change, ex: beans.
newword is the word you want to change the oldword to, ex: rice.


Enjoy
